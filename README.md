Using seeding probability to build a March Madness Bracket

I have been in the bottom 10% of my families march madness pool for the past five years because of my limited college basketball knowledge. 
I am hoping that this year, a bracket based on the seeding probabilities rather than the teams playing will prove to be accurate.

All probabilities used are according to the lower seeded teams odds of advancing. This is to account for the underseeded teams not being unacounted. 


Probability used for first two rounds: https://www.betfirm.com/seeds-national-championship-odds/

Running each program in terminal in order of:
    firstround.py -> roundof32.py -> sweet16.py -> elite8.py -> finalfour.py -> Finals.py
Running while filling out bracket then creating next script with odds adjusted to former predictions. 


After the first three rounds I found myself in the 95th percentile. I then fell and finished in the 70th percentile, 5th place out of 16 people in my families bracket. 

As the tournament went on predictions became closer to a 50-50 guess thus the probabilities played less of a roll. 

Maybe I will pull team data and train model next year ........?
