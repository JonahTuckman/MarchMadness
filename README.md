Using seeding probability to build a March Madness Bracket

I have been in the bottom 10% of my families march madness pool for the past five years because of my limited college basketball knowledge. 
I am hoping that this year, a bracket based on the seeding probabilities rather than the teams playing will prove to be accurate.

All probabilities used are according to the lower seeded teams odds of advancing. This is to account for the underseeded teams not being unacounted.
